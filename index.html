        <p>Great whites can reach speeds up to 24 km/hr (15 mph). Great whites use their speed and coloring to help them hunt. They search for prey at the surface of the ocean while swimming below. Once they spot a target, they use a burst of speed to bump their prey while simultaneously biting it.</p>
